What did you learn?
I learned how to use dynamic memory and pointers. I learned how to make a hashtable using 
C and dynamic memory. I know that lots of companies want you to implement hashtables as 
interview questions so I am glad I did this project. 



How many hours did you work on this project?
I spent about 50 hour.

How many hours did you originally estimate you would need for this project?
I thought I would need at least 25 hours. 



What was easy about this assignment?
There was nothing really easy about this project. It was challenging from the start. 


What gave you problems/troubles?
The sim part of part 2 gave me problems. I could not remove users. 



What can the instructor do to improve this assignment?
Maybe we could have had a lecture on hashing 



What would you have liked to do in this assignment?
I would have liked to implement more hashing algorthims. Like other rehashing methods or other
methods besides open addressing.
